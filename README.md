<h3>my solution to common interview problems</h3>

1. Freq_occuring items -> Finds the maximum occuring character in an array or python list. It only first only one maximum occuring character. 

2. First duplicate -> Finds the number that has duplicate in the list. If there are more than one numbers that are duplicate then it finds the number whose duplicate is index closer to the original number.
